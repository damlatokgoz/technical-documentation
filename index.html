    <header>What is Technical Documentation?</header>
    <p>Documentation is the product of technical writing that refers to different documents with product-related data and information; it has the details about a technical product that is either under development or already in use.</p> <p>It can be printed or online. Technical documentation is created in various industries, for example, in engineering, medicine, IT and so on.</p>
    <p>You may imagine that documentation is just dry text that people with relevant education can read and understand but it’s not true. Nowadays, documentation is more than text — videos, screenshots, charts, diagrams, and other visual elements feature modern manuals. You will fully realize it when you look through doc examples below.</p>

    <header>Who Creates it?</header>
    <p>Usually, technical writers create technical documentation with the help of other groups of professionals like SMEs, designers, developers, reviewers.</p><p> Sometimes, product developers themselves create documentation for their products.</p>

  <section id="What_is_the_Purpose?" class="main-section">
    <header>What is the Purpose?</header>
    <p>The major reasons why companies today create technical documentation are to reduce customer tickets, the expenses on customer service and enable their support team to solve customer queries effectively.</p><p> So, the main purpose of technical documentation is to help users achieve their goal using the product. It can be in the form of a printed or online manual, video, and the like.</p>

    <header>Does Anybody Read Technical Documentation?</header>  <p>In spite of the opinion that nobody reads documentation, manuals are helpful and people read them. Of course, you don’t read a manual for your TV because nobody does it until something go wrong. But in a professional sphere, nobody acts like this.</p><p>As I’ve said above, documentation is used in various spheres, for example, in medicine. As the technology is developing, there are new medicine devices witch accompanying documentation. And, of course, health staff reads it or they are taught before implementing.</p>

    <header>Does it really matter?</header>  <p>Technical documentation matters. Documentation helps users achieve their goals using a product, makes the conquest of space possible and it even saves our lives.</p>

    
    <h2>Some Useful Codes Here<h2>
      <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      <br></br>
      <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
    <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
} else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
       <br></br>
    <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
    <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
     <br></br>
   <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
    <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
    <br></br>
<p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
    <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
